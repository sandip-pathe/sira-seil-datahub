# Demo Readiness Ledger

Updated: 2026-08-02

Branch reviewed: `core-backend`

Implementation reviewed through: `f1d690f` plus the PostgreSQL/Docker laptop follow-up

This ledger reconciles the pre-P0 quality audit at `f4ac492` with the P0 fixes that followed it. It is the short, current checklist for the demo; the earlier audit remains useful background but its original P0 verdict is stale.

## Current verdict

- **GO:** an explicitly labelled, deterministic fixture demo of company-aware evaluation, seller PASS, eligible alternatives, ranking, counterfactual, ledger, and proposed Stackfile patch.
- **GO:** the Docker-backed PostgreSQL/API fixture demo; fresh-volume startup, restricted-role
  readiness, migrations, RLS, reset, and persistence checks pass locally.
- **CONDITIONAL GO:** the complete laptop web journey; UI refresh/E2E remains a separate proof.
- **NO-GO:** claims that arbitrary company intent, Senso retrieval, autonomous agents, or a real Prava/merchant purchase work end to end.
- **NO-GO:** production or real-money use.

## Verified and closed

| ID | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| CORE-01 | **PASS:** The decision engine is deterministic and uses hard eligibility gates before bounded preference/TCO ordering. Missing, stale, or conflicting evidence cannot silently become a pass. | Decision and property suites; frozen demo ledger and hashes. |
| CORE-02 | **PASS:** The demo proves `SIRA_INELIGIBLE`, seller `SEIL_PASS`, eligible runner-up/winner, company-aware winner change, and a proposed Stackfile patch. Seller positioning is excluded from rank. | `tests/unit/test_decision_graph_v1.py`; `tests/unit/test_domain_decision.py`. |
| CORE-03 | **FIXED:** Strict typed comparisons, exact evidence scope, comparable currency/horizon, assessed-evidence risk rules, and coherent deduplication are enforced. | `a1f22bb`. |
| DEMO-01 | **FIXED:** Arbitrary request text can be saved only as an explicitly unevaluated draft. Discovery requires the declared `consultco_meeting_intelligence_v1` scenario, and every request/decision projection carries the non-production fixture mode and label. | Primary and compatibility API tests; frozen Decision View and generated client contracts. |
| CORE-04 | **FIXED FOR THE DEMO:** Replay, simulation, and counterfactual execution resolve the canonical persisted Evaluation Run and verify its input hash, versions, evaluation time, frozen artifact hashes, evaluation hash, and aggregate bindings. If the exact fixture source no longer matches, the operation fails with `REPLAY_INPUT_UNAVAILABLE` instead of substituting current data. | Replay-fidelity unit tests and the combined counterfactual/simulation/replay API regression. |
| CORE-05 | **FOUNDATION COMPLETE:** The deterministic engine now compiles from a complete credential-free `DecisionSourceBundle`, not a filesystem-only loader. Accepted Buyer Passport, Purchase/Requirement Brief, Stackfile, Pack, evidence, offer, contract, usage, taxonomy, and normalization documents are stored as one immutable tenant-scoped source snapshot; discovery, calibration, and accepted rule changes use that exact hash-bound snapshot. The demo snapshot remains explicitly `DEVELOPMENT_FIXTURE`; Senso composition is tracked in CORE-09. | Compiler divergence tests, source-snapshot repository tests, API discovery/calibration regressions, and migration `a4c8e1f7b205`. |
| CORE-06 | **FIXED:** Buyer facts carry actor role and authority. A unique higher-authority assertion wins deterministically; equal-authority disagreement stops compilation unless the Purchase Brief's declared field owner records an explicit selection and reason. The winner, losing fact IDs, roles, strategy, and rationale are frozen into evaluation hashes and the Decision Ledger. | Actor-conflict compiler, hash, gate-lineage, authorization, and ledger tests. |
| CORE-07 | **FIXED FOR DECLARED REQUIRED COMPONENTS:** Pack candidates can declare required products. Plan construction resolves transitive dependencies in stable dependency-first order, blocks missing/ambiguous/cyclic closure, applies hard gates to every component, aggregates preferences with versioned exact operators, and sums bounded TCO and fee lines across the bundle. Broad combinatorial optimization and multi-merchant execution remain deferred. | Two-component ordering/TCO/aggregation tests, weakest-link policy test, and missing/cycle failure tests. |
| CORE-08 | **FIXED:** Recall applies a frozen category/JTBD/region/Pack-status policy before deduplication. Included, deduplicated, and excluded records now have exact counts; exclusions retain stable reason codes in persistence and the Decision Ledger instead of being reported as zero. | Recall coverage, duplicate merge, revoked Pack, ledger, API, and persistence tests. |
| CORE-09 | **COMPOSITION COMPLETE IN CODE:** Folder-scoped Senso search resolves exact content versions before model use. Agent output is a strict advisory fact proposal with zero rank/authority fields; support must be an exact document span. Only an authorized human acceptance creates a Buyer Passport fact. Provider/content/version/chunk/time/evidence hash and production-versus-fixture mode survive into the frozen fact hash. A live credentialed run is still required. | Senso ingestion, unversioned-source rejection, hallucinated-span rejection, authority-boundary, fixture-label, compiler-provenance, agent-runtime, and REST-adapter tests. |
| SEC-02 | **FIXED IN CODE:** Senso document text is explicitly isolated as untrusted evidence data. Reserved decision/payment namespaces cannot be proposed, model tools remain unavailable, instruction/tool/exfiltration/decision-manipulation patterns are flagged, and flagged evidence cannot become a Buyer Passport fact without an explicit human adversarial-content review. Flags are frozen into the accepted source and its hash. | Malicious evidence corpus, reserved-field, exact-span, agent-boundary, schema, lint, and strict typing tests. |
| SEC-03 | **FIXED IN CODE:** Production identity now has a real server-side RFC 7662/OIDC introspection adapter. It verifies active status, issuer, audience, expiry, safe tenant/actor IDs, an explicit role allowlist, identity kind and party. Step-up authority requires both an approved ACR and recent `auth_time`; browser identity headers remain ignored in production, and provider failures return a credential-free retryable error. | Identity-adapter claim matrix, stale step-up, secret-safe outage, production boundary, lint, and strict typing tests. Live identity-provider configuration is still required. |
| SEC-04 | **PASS LOCALLY:** Buyer/seller introductions bind exact parties and a sanitized Requirement Brief grant. PostgreSQL RLS permits only the two bound tenants; a database trigger rejects pre-consented inserts, forged consent provenance/contact data, and immutable-binding changes. | Direct restricted-role PostgreSQL test proves buyer/bound-seller visibility, unrelated-tenant denial, private buyer-table isolation, malicious insert rejection, and both-party mutation boundaries. |
| PAY-01 | **FIXED:** Approval expiry is rechecked at hosted-session creation, browser return, and final dispatch; stale authority becomes `EXPIRED` before side effects. | `47db419`. |
| PAY-02 | **FIXED:** Provider uncertainty and hosted-session failures are recoverable; malformed outbox events no longer starve later work. | `70dc0a3`. |
| PAY-03 | **FIXED:** Fulfillment retries separately from checkout, so paid-but-unfulfilled recovery does not repeat the charge. | `d6ee047`. |
| PAY-04 | **PASS LOCALLY:** Concurrent first idempotency claims use a savepoint, resolve the uniqueness race, and reread the canonical record. | Two independent PostgreSQL sessions are synchronized at the first claim; both return the same 201 response with one intent and one completed idempotency row. |
| PAY-05 | **FIXED IN CODE:** Purchase Intent merchant, Pack, offer, quote, amount, currency, line items, fulfillment expectations, and Stackfile patch now come from a hashed snapshot on the exact persisted selected plan. Missing or altered terms fail closed. | Batch 1 transaction-binding tests; live PostgreSQL proof remains open. |
| PAY-06 | **PASS IN CONTRACT:** Prava binds the exact ISO currency at session creation and the same canonical currency reaches the controlled merchant. The official payment-result response does not return a currency field, so result-time currency comparison is not possible; session/order/amount/merchant checks prevent substitution. | Prava adapter contract tests and official [Create Session](https://docs.prava.space/api-reference/create-session)/[Get Payment Result](https://docs.prava.space/api-reference/get-payment-result) documentation. |
| PAY-07 | **FIXED IN APPLICATION:** An authorized approver can revoke the exact intent hash before merchant dispatch. Revocation invalidates local hosted-session/browser authority, retires queued checkout work, and the worker recheck proves zero Prava or merchant dispatch. | Approval API/domain/worker tests; provider-side session cancellation remains open under LIVE-03. |
| PAY-08 | **FIXED IN CODE:** Lost browser returns and provider uncertainty use a durable Temporal schedule of authoritative merchant/Prava reconciliation. Unknown results are retried with spaced timers, transition keys remain idempotent, fulfillment starts only after confirmed approval, and the workflow records a safe terminal failure only after the schedule is exhausted. | Workflow scheduling, credential-free history, duplicate-transition, checkout recovery, provider adapter, lint, and strict typing tests. |
| PAY-09 | **FIXED IN CODE:** Refunds and cancellations are exact-intent, amount-bounded, idempotent reversal records. The real controlled-merchant adapter mutates once and reconciles by idempotency key; fixture adapters remain pending and cannot claim provider success. A confirmed refund is not complete until paid entitlements are revoked, otherwise the state becomes `COMPENSATION_REQUIRED`. | Reversal API, state-machine, adapter, outbox, Temporal, persistence, and entitlement-revocation tests; migration `e7b4c2d8f105`. |
| CORE-10 | **FIXED IN CODE:** Outcome checkpoints bind the exact decision, selected plan, versioned Purchase Brief metric, direction, target, and window. Measurement starts at the canonical verified-fulfillment transition, raw source references are hashed, and a missed outcome creates a review proposal with no ranking or policy effect. | Purchase Brief schema/fixture, compiler propagation, outcome API and frozen OpenAPI/client tests; migration `e7b4c2d8f105`. |
| CORE-11 | **PASS:** Reuse, deliberate `NO_ACTION`, and `NO_ELIGIBLE_SUPPORTED_ACTION` are separate deterministic outcomes. Reuse and no-action require no payment and can be selected autonomously only after hard gates and stable ordering; an unavailable universe cannot masquerade as a no-buy recommendation. | Coherent graph-level winner scenarios in `tests/unit/test_decision_graph_v1.py`. |
| SEC-01 | **PASS IN CODE:** Production defaults fail closed, fixture adapters are labelled, tenant scoping/RLS policies exist, and the one-time Prava credential stays out of persistence, payloads, workflow history, and errors. | Production-boundary, provider, worker, and contract tests. |
| OPS-01 | **PASS:** Backend CI installs the exact Python and Node lockfiles, runs lint/format/strict typing, executes the full suite against PostgreSQL 16, checks frozen OpenAPI/generated-client drift, and scans the current tree for credentials. The workflow has read-only repository permission, no persisted checkout credential, cancellation for obsolete runs, and a 20-minute ceiling. | [Hosted run 30745639365](https://github.com/sandip-pathe/siel-n-sira/actions/runs/30745639365): 306 tests passed. |

## Required on the laptop for the demo

Use the exact commands and sandbox checklist in `docs/LAPTOP_BACKEND_HANDOFF.md`.

| ID | Priority | Required proof | Done when |
|---|---:|---|---|
| DB-01 | P0 laptop smoke | **PASS locally on existing and fresh Docker volumes.** | Alembic reaches `f8c1d2e3a4b5`; direct runtime is `NOSUPERUSER`, `NOBYPASSRLS`, non-owner, and health rejects the owner/admin login. |
| DB-02 | P0 | **PASS locally on PostgreSQL 17.6.** | Two concurrent first requests produce one canonical idempotency record and intent, identical 201 responses, and no 500. |
| DB-03 | P0 laptop smoke | **PASS locally through restricted roles.** | Buyer and bound seller can read the sanitized engagement; unrelated access, pre-consented inserts, cross-party consent mutation, and forged contact material are denied. |
| DEMO-02 | P0 | **PARTIAL PASS:** fresh Docker PostgreSQL/migrations/API startup and health pass; web refresh and live worker remain separate. | The API is healthy through the restricted login and fixture reset survives post-purchase reversal/outcome records. Worker remains blocked until Temporal/providers are real. |
| UI-01 | P0, UI owner | **Wire or deliberately scope the visible journey.** The current laptop-owned web check fails because two `DecisionRequestView` samples in `apps/web/components/decisions/decision-surfaces.tsx` do not provide the required `evaluation_mode`. | The web typecheck passes, the user can complete the claimed demo path, and unavailable provider actions remain disabled and honestly labelled rather than reporting fake success. |

Docker is now the reproducible laptop path for PostgreSQL and the API. Temporal and live
provider certification remain explicitly separate and are not started by default.

## Required only if the demo claims live sandbox purchasing

| ID | Blocker |
|---|---|
| LIVE-03 | Compose Prava's official [Revoke Session](https://docs.prava.space/api-reference/revoke-session) operation for an already-created hosted session and certify it in sandbox. Application authority revocation already blocks merchant dispatch. |
| LIVE-04 | Configure authentic Prava, controlled merchant/entitlement, Temporal, and HTTPS return URL values and run the real sandbox contracts. Development adapters must remain visibly non-production. |
| LIVE-05 | Prove pending/timeout, unknown result, duplicate attempt, crash-after-charge, and paid-but-unfulfilled recovery against the sandbox without a duplicate charge. |
| LIVE-06 | Configure a real folder-scoped Senso key and OpenAI model, then run the composed ingestion path through human acceptance and a fresh Purchase Brief/source snapshot before claiming live company evidence affected a decision. The code seam is covered by CORE-09; no credentialed run has occurred. |
| LIVE-07 | Certify controlled-merchant refund creation, reconciliation, partial refund behavior, and entitlement revocation in the merchant sandbox. Until then, the fixture reversal remains visibly pending and no refund success is claimed. |

Until those pass, demonstrate the deterministic transaction state machine with labelled fixtures only; do not describe it as a completed purchase.

## Important checks and known misses

| Check | Current evidence |
|---|---|
| Full backend regression | **PASS locally:** 314 tests against Docker PostgreSQL 17.6, including all eight live-PostgreSQL cases. The earlier hosted PostgreSQL 16 baseline remains 306 passing tests. |
| Approval-revocation regression | **PASS:** 37 focused API, domain, and worker tests; frozen OpenAPI and generated client checks pass. |
| PostgreSQL focus | **PASS locally:** eight PostgreSQL tests cover migration/seed, direct runtime readiness and drift rejection, tenant isolation, engagement RLS/mutation guards, true idempotency race, and reset after reversal/outcome records. |
| Python lint | **PASS:** Ruff. |
| Python typing | **PASS:** strict mypy across 84 source files. |
| Python formatting | **PASS:** all 145 Python files match the configured Ruff formatter. |
| Frozen contracts | **PASS:** OpenAPI and generated TypeScript client are current; the shared client typecheck passes. |
| Credential scan | **PASS:** source, configuration, fixtures, migrations, and reachable Git history were checked with project rules plus `detect-secrets`; no credential was detected. Current files receive entropy detection; history ignores entropy-only hits from frozen content hashes while retaining credential-signature detectors. |
| Web application | **FAIL, laptop-owned:** two sample `DecisionRequestView` objects lack `evaluation_mode`; backend/client contract checks remain green and no `apps/web/**` file was changed in this batch. |
| Live providers | **NOT RUN:** credentials and reachable sandbox services are required. |
| Full browser purchase E2E | **NOT RUN:** UI/provider composition is incomplete and owned by the laptop work. |

## Deliberately deferred beyond the demo

These are real launch requirements, but they should not distract from a truthful fixed-scenario demo:

- identity-provider tenant provisioning, invitations, MFA enrollment, and session/token revocation operations;
- dispute adjudication and manual compensation execution after a provider reports an entitlement/refund mismatch;
- automated adoption, ROI, renewal, cancellation, and claim-accuracy learning beyond explicit human-reviewed outcome proposals;
- broad catalog retrieval, mutually exclusive/quantity-constrained optimization, multi-merchant execution, open RFP, and autonomous agent orchestration;
- production deployment, rate limits, telemetry, alerting, backup/restore, load tests, and provider quota controls;
- complete web component/accessibility/E2E coverage and non-critical visual polish.

## Claims boundary

The defensible demo claim is: **"SIRA deterministically evaluates seller-published SEIL evidence against a frozen company context, explains every gate and ordering decision, shows the generic counterfactual, and proposes an auditable Stackfile change."**

Do not yet claim production matching, live Senso intelligence, autonomous purchasing, a real merchant refund, automatic outcome learning, or a production-ready marketplace.
